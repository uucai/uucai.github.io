## Welcome to Zhuangli Cai's Pages

I'm a doctoral candidate at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, China and major in energy and power engineering. My studies focus on heat transport of polymer and perovskite materials at nano- and micro-scale by molcular dynamics simulations and lattice dynamical calculations. I am also a person who stutters and work on helping other stutterers and normal people understand stuttering in China.
